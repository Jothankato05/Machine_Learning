# Anxiety Prediction among University Students

This repository contains a simple Machine Learning project aimed at detecting anxiety trends among university students using basic demographic, academic, and lifestyle factors.

## Project Overview
- **Objective:** Predict whether a student is at risk of anxiety (0 = No Anxiety, 1 = Anxiety) using Decision Tree Classifier.
- **Dataset:** Simulated sample data derived and adapted from the Student Depression Dataset (Kaggle).
- **Methodology:** Data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), model training and evaluation.
